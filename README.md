## Description

This repository includes a Streamlit application that uses various AI models to review Python code. The tool can analyze your code, provide fixed code, and explain any errors. The supported models include OpenAI, DeepSeek R1 Distill, and Meta Llama 3 70B Turbo.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- *Python 3.8 or higher*
- *Git*

## Setting Up Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. Here are the *steps to set up a virtual environment*:

1. *Install Virtual Environment*:
   If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, install it using pip:

   *pip install virtualenv*

2. *Create a Virtual Environment*:
   Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:

   *cd task4-innomatics*

   *virtualenv venv*

3. *Activate the Virtual Environment*:
   - On Windows: Activate the environment from the Scripts directory:

     *.\venv\Scripts\activate*

   - On macOS and Linux: Activate the environment using the bin directory:

     *source venv/bin/activate*

4. *Install Dependencies*:
   With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:

   *pip install streamlit openai requests*

## Usage

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   Download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   *git clone https://github.com/kshitizjangra/task4-innomatics.git*

   *cd task4-innomatics*

2. *Create and Activate the Virtual Environment*:
   Follow the steps in the *Setting Up Virtual Environment* section.

3. *Run the Streamlit Application*:

   *streamlit run app.py*

4. *Open Your Browser*:
   Go to the local server address to access the application:

   *http://localhost:8501*

## Application Overview

The application allows you to input Python code and select an AI model to review the code. The supported models are:

- *OpenAI*
- *DeepSeek R1 Distill*
- *Meta Llama 3 70B Turbo*

## Steps to Use the Application

1. *Enter your API key in the sidebar*.
2. *Select the model you want to use for code review*.
3. *Enter your Python code in the text area*.
4. *Click the "Generate" button to analyze your code*.

The application will display the fixed code and an explanation of any errors.
